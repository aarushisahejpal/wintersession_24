Everything about [html](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)

[Rvest](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/)


```{r}
html <- read_html("http://rvest.tidyverse.org/")
class(html)
```

## Let's give it a try
We are working out of [this]( https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/bridge/nbi/no10/condition23.cfm) Bridge Condition by Highway System 2023 page by the Federal Highway Administration.


```{r}
library(rvest)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)

url <- "https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/bridge/nbi/no10/condition23.cfm"

webpage <- read_html(url)


bridge_all <- html_table(html_nodes(webpage, "table"))[[1]]

bridges <- bridge_all[-1, ]

print(bridges)

write.csv(bridges, "bridges.csv")


```

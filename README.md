Hi, I am Prof. Aarushi Sahejpal. I teach quantitative methods to journalists, policymakers -- and anyone that is not predisposed -- at American University's School of Communication. I hold a dual appointment as Data Editor at the Investigative Reporting Workshop at American University (the nonprofit, editorially-independant newsroom housed here). I also co-teach Programming and Data for Policymakers at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government. More about me at [aarushisahejpal.com](aarushisahejpal.com)

We are going to play around with webscraping, and how journalists use it from day-to-day. There are likely better ways to webscrape in programs like Python but I want to show you how to do it in R because its a good start. 

1. is a link to [The Markup](https://themarkup.org/news/2020/12/03/why-web-scraping-is-vital-to-democracy) and how they explain that webscraping is vital to our demoracy.
2. .Rmd about scraping some federal bridge data.
3. .Rmd recreating a FiveThirtyEight [story](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-dallas-shooting-was-among-the-deadliest-for-police-in-u-s-history/) from 2017 about officer death. All credit to them!
